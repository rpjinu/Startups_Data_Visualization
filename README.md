# Startup Data Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing startup data to uncover trends, insights, and comparisons related to startup growth, exit status, funding, customer base, and more. The dataset includes detailed information about various startups, such as sector, funding stages, valuation, exit status, customer base, and much more.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains information on over 12,000 startups across multiple sectors. It includes various fields, such as:

- **Sector**: Industry to which the startup belongs (e.g., HealthTech, EdTech, Retail).
- **Funding Stage**: The funding stage of the startup (e.g., Seed, Series A, Series B).
- **Exit Status**: Whether the startup has exited (e.g., IPO, Acquisition, or no exit).
- **Growth Rate**: The growth rate of the startup.
- **Customer Base Size**: The size of the customer base.
- **Investment Type**: The type of investment (e.g., Equity, Convertible Note).

The main goal of this project is to create visualizations and analysis that provide insights into:

- Growth trends across different sectors.
- The impact of funding stages on growth.
- Sector-based comparisons on customer base sizes and exit statuses.
